Today is exactly 1 year since I joined Rwanda Coding Academy. It's been a great year with the most improvement ever. I was introduced to software engineering industry and now I'm a full stack developer. I'm grateful to the academy for the opportunity and I'm looking forward to the next year. Throughout this year I managed to develop the following web applications:

1. Photo Corner - Social media app (https://photocorner.vercel.app/)
2. Infinity - Gaming app (https://infinity1.vercel.app/)
3. Oneplay - Media player app (https://oneplay.vercel.app/)
4. All Football - football update app (https://allfootball.vercel.app/)
5. HiTech - tech products app (https://hitech1.vercel.app/)
6. Movies250 - movies app (https://movies250.vercel.app/)
7. Quizzy - quiz app (https://quizzy-green.vercel.app/)

I'm also trying to develop a few mobile apps using react-native:
1. Photo Corner (https://github.com/NdungutseCharles103/Photo_Corner_RN)
2. Movies250 (https://github.com/NdungutseCharles103/movies250_RN)

I'm also working on a few projects with my team members.
